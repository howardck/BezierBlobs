    this special version in br IPHONE_ANIMATION_FOR_VIDEO
    is especially adapted for a short iphone-based animated gig. it
    1) hardwires smaller marker radii than usual,
    2) changes descriptors for slightly tighter offsets and deltas, and
    3) changes animation so that we start in an animated zigged state
        and return to that same configuration on a 2-click, so that
        an animated gif of the same can repeat endlessly smoothly.
        
    specific changes are noted here :

    LayersSelectionList.CheckBox

    how hard would it be to do a single arm/tentacle animation??
    THIS WOULD BE FUN TO FIGURE OUT.
    TURN ON baseCurve + markers + vertex[0] TO WATCH

    App VERSION 2: MAYBE add further options to MiscOptionsChooser:
    
    enum OptionType: String {
    ...
    case fixedZigZags = "fixed zig-zags"
    case snapToZigZags = "\"snap-to\" zig-zags"
    case animatedZigZags = "animated zig-zags"
    }
    
    o (1) of first 11feb21 TO-DO is done
    o earlier 11Feb21 TO-DO -- use two buttons -- is now done

    TO DO: greatly simplfiy Model handling of ZigZag curves :
    
        1) move to own file/struct
        2) remove much code by using randomPerturbationDeltas
            of [0.0, 0.0 ... etc] limits to remove plain-jane versions
        3) and we can calc blobLimits(inner: , outer: ) to simplify
            their calculation

iphone version respects dark mode, unless you've altered the color of a List:Section header text color.
ipad version apparently doesn't

two List dialogs (Layers & OtherMisc) invoked from single button --
works great on iPad, but the two dialogs overlap each other on
iPhone in a way hard to get full access to both --
MAYBE back to the idea of separate invocation button on phone ????

    -- DONE --
