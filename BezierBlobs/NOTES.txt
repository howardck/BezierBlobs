    TO DO: greatly simplfiy Model handling of ZigZag curves :
    
        1) move to own file/struct
        2) remove much code by using randomPerturbationDeltas
            of [0.0, 0.0 ... etc] limits to remove plain-jane versions
        3) and we can calc perturbLimits(inner: , outer: ) to simplify
            their calculation

iphone version respects dark mode, unless you've altered the color of a List:Section header text color.
ipad version apparently doesn't

two List dialogs (Layers & OtherMisc) invoked from single button --
works great on iPad, but the two dialogs overlap each other on
iPhone in a way hard to get full access to both --
MAYBE back to the idea of separate invocation button on phone ????

    -- DONE --
