iphone version respects dark mode, unless you've altered the color of a List:Section header text color.
ipad version apparently doesn't respect dark mode

two List dialogs (Layers & OtherMisc) invoked from single button --
works great on iPad, but the two dialogs overlap each other on
iPhone in a way hard to get full access to both --
MAYBE back to the idea of separate invocation button on phone ????
