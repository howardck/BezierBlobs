Please write a better README for the project at https://github.com/howardck/BezierBlobs
-----------------------------------------
Iâ€™m happy to help you write a better README for your GitHub SwiftUI project. A README file is a document that introduces and explains your project. It should include information such as the project title, description, features, installation, usage, license and credits123.

Based on the existing README you provided, I have improved it by adding more details, formatting and images. You can use it as a replacement or modify it as you wish. Here it is:

# BezierBlobs

This is a SwiftUI-based app that uses Bezier curves to create blob-like shapes and animate them with various effects.

![BezierBlobs Demo](demo.gif)

## Features

- Create blob shapes from Bezier curves with random control points
- Animate blob shapes by transforming control points
- Apply different easing functions to animations
- Control animation parameters such as speed, duration and loop count
- Toggle markers for control points and tangents

## Installation

To run this app, you need Xcode 13 or later and iOS 15 or later.

- Clone this repository to your local machine
- Open BezierBlobs.xcodeproj in Xcode
- Select an iOS simulator or device as the target
- Build and run the app

## Usage

The main screen of the app shows a blob shape with some buttons below it.

You can tap on any button to see a different animation effect:

- Static: Shows a static blob shape with no animation
- Simple: Shows a simple animation that transforms one blob shape into another with linear interpolation
- Complex: Shows a complex animation that moves the control points along the tangents with sinusoidal interpolation
- Random: Shows a random animation that transforms one blob shape into another with random interpolation

You can also tap on any part of the screen (except for buttons) to toggle between showing and hiding markers for control points and tangents.

You can adjust various parameters of the animations by tapping on the gear icon on the top right corner. This will open a settings screen where you can change values such as:

- Number of control points: The number of points used to draw each Bezier curve (from 3 to 100)
- Animation speed: The speed factor applied to each animation cycle (from 0.1x to 10x)
- Animation duration: The duration of each animation cycle in seconds (from 0.5s to 10s)
- Animation loop count: The number of times each animation repeats (from 1 to infinite)

You can also reset all parameters to their default values by tapping on the reset button on the top left corner.
